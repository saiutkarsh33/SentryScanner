# Welcome to Team Sentrii's Crypto.com APAC Hackathon Repo

We have come up with a solution that aims to tackle financial losses due to online scams like phishing sites and scam tokens.

Our solution includes having a ML model to recognise words commonly used in phishing URLs and also a token (smart contract) scanner chrome extension.

For the source code of our **ML model**, go to the directory: `/ML Model`

```
cd ML_Model
```

For the source code of our **extension**, go to the directory: `/sentryscanner`

```
cd sentryscanner
```
Edit: We won the hackathon!
